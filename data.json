Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\nWhy do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.","share":0,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":75,"created_at":"2020-04-17 08:58:25","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":59,"text":"test 123","share":1,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":1,"created_at":"2020-04-17 09:26:17","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":60,"text":"Ghvhgh","share":1,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":89,"created_at":"2020-04-17 10:01:05","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":61,"text":"Dr hghj","share":1,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":91,"created_at":"2020-04-17 10:18:21","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":62,"text":"Hhh","share":1,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":92,"created_at":"2020-04-17 10:20:05","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":63,"text":"Test","share":1,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":93,"created_at":"2020-04-17 10:51:15","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":64,"text":"Dugguh","share":1,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":94,"created_at":"2020-04-17 10:53:32","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":65,"text":"hhgfhg","share":1,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":95,"created_at":"2020-04-17 11:01:18","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":67,"text":"Please share your fears, frustrations, and needs, and what is helping you get through this crisis.

My children are needing much more support from me and now there are no gaps of time that they are somewhere (like school) that I can do the things I need\/want to do.  So I feel like I'm in this limbo where I'm not totally quarantined because I'm still surrounded by others (my children and husband) and I'm already not a touchy\/feely person so it bothers me that I'm depended upon to make someone else feel good or process what is going on when I really don't think I've fully processed it.  I also feel guilty about feeling that way because it's mostly my youngest (7yrs old) that has become more needy and is having a very hard time with this.  I'm overwhelmed with the requirements of homeschooling, trying to keep up with all of the things people are sending, trying to help others when possible and having to check in with family, friends, etc \nThis has been an interesting experience but overall it is more apparent to me that I am truly blessed as I have all the necessities.

He continues to take the children outside the home during his parenting time, in congested pedestrian areas, etc. and ignores the executive order to stay home.  He even brought my son to his workplace 3 x this week!  Completely unacceptable from a health and safety standpoint.  My needs are to find a balance for myself and my kids in managing any anxiety and keeping a healthy mindset during this crisis.  My daughter has begun to pull away from communicating with all of her friends, and won\u2019t leave our house if she sees even 1 other person outside (we are sheltering in place in a small town far from any hotspots).  I worry about agoraphobia symptoms for her, as this is becoming a pattern of behavior and she is already diagnosed with social  anxiety.  She is also refusing to participate\u2014in any way\u2014in her online classes, so this is a huge cause for concern for her.  Having a safe place to stay, outside of the hot zone area where we live, has been a huge relief for me as a mother to keep my children safe when they are with me.","share":0,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":138,"created_at":"2020-04-18 15:45:00","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":110,"text":"We truly hope this ends soon and they come up with a vaccine.","share":1,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":null,"created_at":"2020-04-18 16:09:02","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":111,"text":"We truly hope this ends soon and they come up with a vaccine.","share":1,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":null,"created_at":"2020-04-18 16:09:32","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":112,"text":"Anxiety, anxiousness, paranoid to go shopping, depressed, helpless, cabin fever","share":1,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":null,"created_at":"2020-04-18 16:13:53","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":113,"text":"testing","share":1,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":139,"created_at":"2020-04-18 16:25:58","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":114,"text":"test","share":1,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":null,"created_at":"2020-04-18 16:27:27","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":115,"text":"I\u2019m worried that my children will lose their routinely habits to help them succeed academically.

Our son has asthma and my husband has hypertension - both of which increase our risks.   The benefit of being in a much more rural environment and one that is familiar is that the kids seem to have handled the change in our daily lives in stride.  They do not see the fear, hear the sirens or feel the restrictions of staying at home that those in the city do on a daily basis.   They miss the city and their friends but they are sheltered from the worst of the news and incredibly lucky.   The adjustment to remote learning has been tough for both children (one with special needs and one without).  Google classrooms, demands from multiple teachers has increased my son's anxiety and highlighted his lack of executive functioning skills.   I do fear that both my children are slipping academically and it is a constant battle to try to balance their mental well-being with the academic demands.  I berate myself daily for not being a better mother.  Whether it is more patience, more physical hugs, more \"quality\" interaction with the kids etc.  Every day feels the same and I need some alone time to keep my sanity.  I worry about my elderly parents who live abroad and feel powerless to help them.   I wish the DOE would highlight the importance of a child's mental well-being and have classes be graded on a pass\/fail basis as it has been done here locally.  Being away has really highlighted how much pressure students and parents are under in the city and truly, needlessly.  From the obscene amount of test prep for public 4th graders to the keeping up with the Joneses academic supplements via tutors\/classes.  It's just too much. \n Some good news is that these deficiencies that we have been telling his teachers and school for years are now hard to ignore.  Also, we have been able to get my son more services than before as his school's old argument \"It would do him more harm to pull him from the classroom.\" no longer holds.   I hope that school wraps up earlier this year.  After everything families have gone through, everyone could use a breather.  I look forward to having the kids \"just play\" this summer instead of loading them up with activities.   What has been interesting is seeing how differently people respond to a crisis.

What I do find to be frustrating is the reaction of those that do not take the restrictions seriously which will lead to a longer period with restrictions.  I could not even imagine what our healthcare workers are experiencing everyday under these horrific conditions.  Financially it is a hardship, but I would not want to be responsible to unknowingly pass on this virus to others that could be at high risk.  This is a situation that my generation nor my parents generation has experienced . It is frightening to see such a sudden change in life as we have always known it, but it is a small price to pay when you see the news and read about all of the people that have already have lost their lives. The restrictions are a minor inconvenience-especially when you hear the stories from within our healthcare system and the horrific situation that they are experiencing everyday watching people die and not being able to help them.  I understand for the younger generation this is a hardship because they can\u2019t understand that living life as they have always done could lead to so many people losing theirs.  I personally have been getting through this time by getting things done that seem to get put off when life is normal.  Feeling at least to accomplish something is cathartic during these times.  If we were more aware of the catastrophic effects this would bring earlier in the year we could have all been better prepared.  With the amazing advances in technology, science and the medical community somehow as a country we should have and could have had a better plan in place much earlier had we all been informed to prepare better. Life as we know it won\u2019t resume as before for quite awhile and I think it is something we are going to have to adjust to as a new \u201cnormal\u201d.  We should consider how lucky we are with all of the advanced technology that life at home is not so terribly isolated.

He has challenges and difficulties doing online school and doesn't see why he has to be in the online school. \"I am just fine with the work packets that my school has sent home, why should I have to do online school?\" those were the words he screamed out when told about the remote learning plan.

He was crying profusely, screaming that  he couldn't breath, his nose was block and was in a great discomfort. I  took care of him and had to make this report to his school that he was not ready to join the online learning and doesn't want to show his face on the video. The principal and advisor understood his situation and provided an accommodation that he could continue off camera till he was confident and comfortable with the videoing but must be involved in all classes for his attendance to count.

We have 3 kids in our household 9, 6 and a toddler who is about turn 2. Remote learning has been very difficult for my mental health as my school age children are both rather scattered and hard to sit still to do anything. I also have a hard time juggling both of them studying simultaneously because both of them keep calling me and talking to me at the same time non-stop. All the while the toddler needs attention, too,. I often feel I am in a form of torture to constantly being talked to from multiple persons, no time to even go to the bathroom without anyone bothering me. It is also hard that there are always glitches with system. You start one thing on a child on ipad but that does not allow them to complete the assignment because the format does not allow them to type their answers, for example. The list goes on. All the while I have my own work to worry about, and I feel like I am always being chased from work, kids, and everything else. \n\nMy partner is not much of help with kids - or around the house in general. He doesn't feel comfortable helping with kids with school work which I can understand, but it is almost like having another kid at home which can be frustrating in times.\nIt is also hard to have conversations with the ones who have no other obligations but themselves. Pay reduction affects us greatly since I have 4 others to provide  for. I was in a casual text conversation with one of my colleague who was close in my age but no partner or child. When I mentioned I was a little freaked out about the amount of pay reduction I saw on the paycheck, she lectured me in a chastising manner how I should try to save money by making food at home and saving money, do more things to save money by stocking up by making food in bulk and eat the same thing, etc. etc. She was saying how she was saving so much money because she was stuck at home and not spending money. I realize her life evolves around going out all the time and socializing with people, eating out, drinking, etc. and not doing that, of course she spends less and saves money. She also has no others to dictates her time that she has \"a lot of time' on her hand to do stuff or nothing. She can spend the day however she wishes. If she chooses not to eat all day, no one objects, but I cannot do that when kids are constantly telling me they are hungry and want to eat something. Hearing other people like that, I get extremely frustrated. This being at home all day every day does not bother me if I was home alone. But it's a completely different thing when I am home with little kids who require constant attention including while doing school work. I feel extreme stress during this time as I have no place to excuse myself to. I really wish that I had more \"alone time\" that I could utilize for whatever it is - sleeping, cleaning, picking up the things I stopped doing as I became working mom, even just reading. \nDespite that, I am grateful that I have kids around me to tell me they love me and give me hugs, enjoy meals together and watch TV, I know some people are forced to be alone with little to no human contact. I also feel that my eldest son is doing better with school work since we spend a lot of time working together every day. We received a weekly email from the principal and she was saying how parents should not be helping their kids with their school work - but they are not proving enough time with instructions and support, especially for kids who need more individual attention like ours. I don't think I will stop helping my kids with school work throughout the day, but rather, I would like to figure out the way to transition him into start working more independently each day while knowing the support is there whenever he needs. Just trying to focus on finishing the tasks get me through the day, but it is always challenging to stay calm. Every day is full of frustration and anxiety.\nHopefully this time allows my eldest to learn more and increase confidence with school work, and increase appreciation for being able to be outside and do things freely.","share":2,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":206,"created_at":"2020-04-20 17:28:11","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":179,"text":"It is truly a trying time.

It's simultaneously grounding to get up every weekday and know I can be in contact with others virtually and be useful, and,  also exhausting. It's exhausting to hold the stress, anxiety, and frustration of so many families each day - while setting aside my own concerns about when and how I'll get groceries, when I'll be able to fly to see my parents again, and my own day-to-day struggle to maintain my mental and physical health. On the flip side, I've also experienced tremendous benefits of this time. More time with my husband. More time to cook healthy meals and exercise (in my apartment). More time to explore other hobbies and projects that typically get left to the side as a busy New Yorker always on the go. More conversations with friends who live far away. I'm not sure what going back to \"normal\" will even look like at this point - mostly because I don't think that the \"normal\" we left exists for any of us anymore.

My biggest fear for my family, at the moment, is regression. My husband and I had been working on connection and communication before the virus hit, and finally had a sitter lined up for monthly dates. Now that we are home together all day juggling work & kids, we are over-extended, stressed, and want to be alone, separately, after the kids go to bed. Quite the opposite of connection. Our older child has ADHD, and at school has an IEP and is in an ICT classroom. Her routine has completely changed, and she no longer has supports in place to guide her with schoolwork.  I hear her virtual classroom meetings, and the teachers are hard on the kids about deadlines and promptness. It both breaks my heart and makes me incredibly frustrated and angry. I worry that she cannot keep up with the classwork, will be penalized for it in her grades, and her self esteem will suffer. We need the teachers to be more understanding, and the school system to support them. Also, it is hard to peel a kid with ADHD off of a computer! Screen time has gone way up, and exercise way down, which is absolutely affecting moods. I am seeing depressive symptoms, and that is a big concern. Our younger, neurotypical child is super social and misses her friends. She was excelling at school, and sadly finds online school boring and has lost interest. Her teachers are supportive of her social-emotional needs, and have encouraged the kids while letting parents steer for a while. I fear the kids will regress academically and socially, not have closure to their year, and become depressed little people.  I fear I will regress professionally, as my job is currently on the back burner. I've had to halt work due to the nature of my job, and as a self-employed person have lost income. I am now overseeing the kids' school day & tending to their needs full time. \n\nMy biggest frustration of all is not having outdoor space at our home for our children. We live in the city with no yard, no way to be outdoors without a planned outing. We also do not have many places to go safely. The city park is crowded, so we have to be careful outside. Our regular neighborhood walks are becoming a bore to our kids. It is difficult being home all day, and living on top of neighbors who are home as well & can hear our every move. It is incredibly stressful telling children to be quiet all day. \n\nWhat is helping us through this is taking advantage of any of the positives. With school starting later, our kids get more sleep, and I can take them on morning walks before class begins. We get to have that connection time first thing in the morning. The kids are becoming more independent, making their own lunches, and wanting to help with meals. Seeing our kids find new interests has been enlightening. I never knew our older child was into coding, and has a knack for making videos.  I see our younger daughter start to wake up early to read more advanced chapter books, which she would not have had the inclination to do after a long day at school. I see them being adaptive people & know they will be okay. I've started giving myself breaks after dinner to do a crossword puzzle while my husband takes over care of the kids and chores. I started listening to podcasts that are not news-based, just purely enjoyable...I stick in my ear buds when I need a moment to myself. While Zoom has become tiresome, regular phone calls with friends has been helpful. Doing more weekend activities, like movie nights and puzzles, during the week has made long days more bearable.","share":0,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":230,"created_at":"2020-04-23 18:19:11","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":209,"text":"I am a mom of 2 and my partner is working full time and sometimes overtime since a lot of people have been let go in his job.

For example, I entered myself under the \"other\" category, which contains the following its description: \"Beyond loneliness, there can be a sense of fear and uncertainty of what the future has in store\". A hundred and fifty years ago the majority of people would have watched a third of their children die slowly in front\u00a0of their\u00a0eyes from one disease or another. Women had little in the way of property\u00a0rights or freedom. African Americans lived under Jim Crowe. An enormous\u00a0number of women died in childbirth. And yet 150 years ago misery and unhappiness were not the norm. People still found joy and love in life. They may have been happier than we are now,\u00a0even before the\u00a0pandemic. If one of them were next to me right now and confronted with the idea that I might be lonely or fearful, they would think me ridiculous. Fearful and lonely or not, I refuse to have sympathy for myself. If this gets challenging, I just pull Camus or Sartre off the bookshelf to remind myself of how absurd and transitory our conception of normal is. It seems that every year, we Americans become more wed to the idea that pain and suffering are fundamentally\u00a0bad things,\u00a0and that incredible effort must be made to\u00a0stamp out our pain and suffering. Since it is, in fact,\u00a0impossible to fully remove pain and suffering from life, this just ends up emphasizing the pain and suffering that we inevitably\u00a0face at one point or another. If there is something to resent about pain and suffering, it would be their imposition on our agency, not our level of comfort. Making myself a slave to the avoidance\u00a0of pain only amplifies its corruption of my agency, on what makes me human. Better to stare into the abyss with a grin on my face, even if its a bit forced. I am a human being, and I am capable of disciplining my emotions. I review my thought process, the motivations behind my actions, the determining factors behind the inflection of my words, and the intonation of my voice. If I don't like what I see, I take a mental scalpel\u00a0and cut it out. It works at least some of the time. The only thing I fear is complacency. When I fall short of that standard I make no excuses for myself.\u00a0","share":1,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":234,"created_at":"2020-04-24 08:22:49","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":220,"text":"Frustrated over homeschooling 4 different grades (2nd,3rd, 4th and 5th) while working full time","share":1,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":null,"created_at":"2020-04-24 12:36:35","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":221,"text":"I am a single mother with 4 elementary school kids.

In this time of crisis, many longstanding inequalities that have been an accepted feature of our lives have fall into stark painful relief as the divide between people who can stay home and isolate and those who cannot reveals how unjust our institutions and systems are. Meanwhile the investor class and billionaires, corporations and CEOS get bailouts  while working people, the poor, and those already marginalized bear the greatest burden with the least amount of relief. Though my own life is one of relative privilege and comfort, I am sick and tired of an America that continues to sacrifice human lives over capitalism, and refuses to place any checks or balances on the unrestrained greed of the top upper fractional percent of our society. I am tired of a country that does not value people and human life first. The fact that we are even debating... saving more human lives or restarting our economy is ridiculous. Normal wasn't good or healthy for so many of us. Normal isn't worth going back to. It never was. I want what comes after coronavirus to be better for all Americans, not just the well-off and privileged. Not just the billionaire investor class, CEOs, and shareholders.  I want to leave that normal behind us, knowing it was never really a normal worth having.  That is my greatest source of frustration and anxiety. Though I may have some personal fears about the future, I know my fate is more than likely to be generally better than most people. Certainly better than people currently on unemployment, or those without health insurance, or enough food to eat, standing in an endless line at a food bank. I'm likely not going to suffer any of those fates, and even if I do, I'm also likely to have family to rely upon that will be able to slow or soften any fall. Most people aren't as lucky. And this is intolerable. We as a people cannot wait any longer for a society that is actually going to take care of its people, rather than treat them like the extractive resource of neoliberal capitalism.  This deep injustice. The vast inequality. The suffering of everyday people that could  be ameliorated if we had values and policies in place, and the political will to make changes.

I do not want to open my school in the fall. I am acutely aware that distance learning is not the best way to teach children, but it is good enough and it certainly beats dying.

It is a truth, however, that I would make more money with the current Unemployment programs in place.\n\nI feel fear because, as the only parent for my kids and my nephew, every decision I make is critical.

I don\u2019t want people to get sick anymore, but it\u2019ll be bittersweet when our shelter in place order is lifted.","share":1,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":null,"created_at":"2020-05-03 00:24:08","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:15","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":330,"text":"I\u2019m feeling insecure about my relationship because I don\u2019t have a job.

I do not have the patience for homeschooling which is already a huge challenge for my children.  I am as frustrated as they are navigating Zoom calls when all we want to do is go for a walk, complete a baking project or enjoy arts and crafts.  There are moments I hear my kids engage with teachers and I take a deep breadth and smile.  But I already have anxiety about the call ending and another fight and frustration to get them on the next call.  As 1st grade and kindergarteners they are having issues navigating zoom schedules on their own.\r\n\r\nI have lost my job and live in fear that although I saved enough to get us through the next few months, the long term effects on my families financial future is in danger.  The weight is terrifying.\r\n\r\nAll of this is balanced by the joy.  Due to circumstances my family was blessed with a free place to stay by the beach for March, April and May.  Instead of lockdown in NY we have walks on the beach, bikes rides and in many ways a quality of life we have never known.  At the end of May we have to face what is next...do we go home to New York City?  Can we go home?  Can we afford not too?  My children who already have a host of sensory issues and struggle would go from thriving to real misery, or so I imagine.  I am full of fear about what is next and try to balance that with the month of birds singing we have left.\r\n\r\nWith no job, my kids also have no camp, no soccer leagues, no way to engage other kids.  My husband has his job and is earning but just enough to pay our mortgage and health insurance.  Life is a rollercoaster of unknown and uncertainty.  As a mom I am afraid but as a human I know we will all get through.","share":0,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":287,"created_at":"2020-05-04 15:23:41","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:15","rank":null,"hide":0,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":335,"text":"test","share":0,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":0,"user_id":288,"created_at":"2020-05-04 16:40:47","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:15","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":336,"text":"Test","share":0,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":0,"user_id":288,"created_at":"2020-05-04 16:45:14","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:15","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":337,"text":"test","share":0,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":0,"user_id":288,"created_at":"2020-05-04 17:01:32","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:15","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":338,"text":"test","share":0,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":0,"user_id":288,"created_at":"2020-05-04 17:01:51","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:15","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":339,"text":"I am concerned that teletherapy is not enough to teach students and would need more\r\nServices","share":1,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":null,"created_at":"2020-05-04 17:03:07","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:15","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":340,"text":"Overwhelmed some days.","share":0,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":0,"user_id":null,"created_at":"2020-05-04 19:51:49","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:15","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":341,"text":"I am afraid for the future","share":1,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":0,"user_id":289,"created_at":"2020-05-05 07:54:09","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:15","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":342,"text":"My fear is that my son will be emotionally impacted by the virus.

My lungs have never fully recovered from the severe case of Swine flu. \r\nI normally work nine to five and there\u2019s have been times over the past two years when I\u2019ve felt very tired and weary. But it wasn\u2019t until this pandemic hit that I actually felt old for the first time in my life. I\u2019ll admit that I went into a blind spin panic when I realised how bad this pandemic was at the end of March. Stress being one of the triggers for my asthma, the feeling of dread and tightness in my chest caused my asthma to peak. I remembered how ill i was in 2009 and the feeling that I just wanted to die and due to my weakened lungs I couldn\u2019t shake the fear. I rang my doctor (not wanting to visit the surgery) and she advised I double up my asthma medication and issued a prescription for extra supplies. My son went to pick it up from the pharmacy the next day, only to discover they couldn\u2019t get supplies of my usual medication. Another call to my doctor and she prescribed an alternative to the medication I had been on since 2010 and my initial asthma diagnosis. A few days later my wheezing had eased but I found I was suffering from severe reflux at nights. So bad it almost choked me on a few occasions, thus adding to my considerable stress. Another call to my doctor, who said the reflux was caused by stress so I was given acid suppressants and signed off work until everything could settle down a bit. I work for a train operating company so I am considered a key worker. \r\nIn summary, I have found the last six weeks to be the most stressful weeks of my life. I\u2019ve always considered myself to be as fit and able as my younger colleagues but this crisis has made me realise I need to take better care of myself and not put my job first.

I finished my internships and licensure exam, while I was pregnant with our second child. Our first child is a boy who is seven, eight this summer. At around the middle of my pregnancy with our now daughter, I became very ill and basically quarantined to our couch. I was unable to begin working at the hospital I completed my second internship. So before any of this even happened I was confined, sick and restless. On February 5th, 2020, I gave birth to a healthy, beautiful baby girl... right before all hell broke loose. We made it home and had one or two visitors before we decided to completely isolate ourselves from the world. The isolation orders had not yet been set, but we told everyone we were concerned enough about Corona and the common flu to not have anyone over to meet our newest family member. Then the actual orders were given and things everywhere began closing. My husband was told to work from home for the foreseeable future, and I was catapulted into the role of home school teacher with a newborn in my arms. I was sleep deprived. I didn't physically or mentally feel like myself. I hadn't been out of the house in an amount of time I couldn't even calculate, and all of a sudden we were trapped with a dog, a cat, close neighbors, a second grader with advanced work, a bread winner who had just turned his only office into a bright coral nursery, a frazzled second time mom, and a newborn. It was chaos. The worst, saddest part, we were some of the luckiest people we knew. Many were forced to still be on the front lines. Friends lost their jobs or were laid off. Hair dresser friends were told not to work and were not given unemployment. Others had even more children to home school. Some had both parents still working and no one to provide childcare. Everyone was scared. Everyone was uncertain and angry out of fear. I utilized my mom as an impromptu phone therapist for myself and was a therapist for many friends. Did I forget to mention that just as my daughter was born my student loans became due? Yeah, and we didn't technically qualify for any type of interest free deferment because we weren't directly impacted by Covid as none of us had it and my husband, who was the sole earner before this happened, was still able to work from home. So I had to put my massive student loan debt into hardship forbearance and I am still accumulating crazy interest. I cannot yet go back to work as I was going to work in a hospital and I am terrified of bringing Covid home to my young children due simply to my work locale. I also have no one able to watch out son, or, more importantly, home school him on the 437 websites he's required to log into every single day, help on zoom meetings he should be attending, or check hard copy papers that make me hate common core mathematics. Everything and everyone has been in a constant state of stress. Our son was a jolly baby who rarely cried and smiled constantly. Our daughter seems more fussy and quicker to be displeased as if she's absorbing this terrible time she was born into. I hate that. Worse than anything I hate the impact this will have on my children. I have discussed things profusely with my son (as, again, I am in mental health) and he's doing wonderfully with it all. I'm very proud of him. But I know he's watching too much television or kids YouTube when I need to get a feeding in for the baby. I know he's not getting outside enough as I can't lay down my infant or she refuses to sleep and having a friend come help out for an hour here and there just isn't an option. I believe he'll be fine through all of this. I worry more about our daughter. Even though she's over three months now and technically out of the \"high risk\" stage for infants, she is still very young and susceptible in my mind. What happens if my son is allowed to go back to school in the fall and he brings EVERYTHING home to her? What kind of world will she grow up in? Will MY debt crush her? Will I ever be able to work and send her to be watched by others without fear? Will she ever get to go shopping in a shopping mall or go physically see a movie in a theater? Will this have irreparable effects on her mental health and overall happiness? Is she now wired for stress and negativity? (Despite my ability to teach her how to fight them.) I have no idea the answers. Will things get worse? Will my children even want to bring their own children into this world if it is worse? This brings up the question of security of our genealogical line? Will we have grandchildren? Will all of society have imploded by then, considering how well we did with a simple toilet paper shortage? The spiraling questions are endless. The spiraling questions my future clients will be asking themselves for the next couple decades will be even more.\r\nI commend Dr. Koplewics for gathering anecdotal research during this time. If nothing else, you served as a mock CBT journaling assignment for anyone willing to participate.\r\nThank you, and best of luck,\r\nTMHFisher, MEd  LPC","share":1,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":1,"user_id":null,"created_at":"2020-05-17 13:52:40","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:15","rank":null,"hide":0,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":448,"text":"I am failing as a mother, teacher, wife, student, friends, and employee","share":0,"voice":"parent","contribute_to_science":0,"user_id":null,"created_at":"2020-05-17 20:40:26","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:15","rank":null,"hide":1,"where_from":"https:\/\/crisislogger.org","privacy_update_date":"2020-07-31 09:38:19","encrypted":1},{"id":449,"text":"I worry that the excessive screen time (particularly video games) will have a lasting negative impact on my 7 year old.

Things seem well then I realize co parent is not going to understand or have any plan to. He gets along great with his son and our son wants to stay. I take my daughter and agree to let my son stay. I have sole and legal and after 3 yrs it seemed to be better for them. I never realized I did all I could and took all classes and it was he who still had a problem and was blaming me. My daughter and I left. A yr later I fly her to stay at her step dads until I'm able to make it to az. Complications arose and the school and co parent had to get an emergancy order. I was incarcerated and the county said even with court order that I could not go and that they would not help. I'm here since March I obscounded I get here and get a home and visiting my children despite I can't make it to court. The virus is what? I remember when co parent took our son to his familys and it was ten days after my son was critical in hospital before they told me he almost died co parent said I was an ilicite drug user so when I arrived at hospital with restraining order needless to say I was snubbed. I used the order to get into the hospital and did not do anything further. He needed to be there. They said my sons health was severe. They never asked me his history they wouldn't except the samples of the water or soul or facts about the family from another country while I was pregnant so I new nothing I was treated badly. I only wanted to find out if somehow we had done something wrong that could have been prevented. They didn't care. I let them do there job. Thank god my son got better. I'm still uncertain and am very worried that my son may become I'll. Co parent is very ill and wears a sleep c pap and he said its gotten worse. I'm in fear that he may be covid and not vetting tested. My boyfreind has pulmonary and he got tested and he has not gotten covid. I'm going to get tested today but how do I make sure that he gets tested and that my son and daughter get tested when I can't even get to court yet to respond. I'm doing the best I can but I'm totally thinking that if I had the tools I would want to go get tested and somehow get my children tested and do anything I can in the mean time to get a job so that I can take care of my children like I had there whole lives. I just want everyone to be as healthy as possible. I don't think it should be an argument with co parent he's not thinking of our children or anyone by leavening me in the dark always blameing me when I've done everything I can any time for us all. Please send me any thought on how to fix things by keeping everyone accountable but not separating us all more like a group focus for a family situation. Why make people separate in crisis why not teach how to work through it and strength in familys there's plenty of kids without parents who can be in the systems we are living parents that just need to be taught what's write from wrong in a family setting so that any mental abuse can be corrected. All separating everyone does just causes confusion and pain and encourages not learning or following through cause things are emberasing or hard. Thats not an option.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem IpsumIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\r\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.\r\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.

There is a lot of loose language in this questionnaire. My physical health does not have the capacity to worry (see question language above). I'm spending a lot of time gardening. There are some art projects previously on the back-burner that I've made progress on. \\u00a0To be perfectly honest, I spend that vast majority of my time building things, making art, gardening, and reading. My routine hasn't changed that much. My insomnia is a lot worse, but that's it as far as measurable negatives go. Once you've made bipolar 1 your bitch most other challenges in life seem rather pedestrian. \\u00a0Side note since I know who's reading this and I'm feeling self-indulgent + can't sleep, the idea of a \\\"bipolar spectrum\\\" is complete nonsense. \\\"Bipolar spectrum\\\" positions those of us with the core bipolar genotype (Lithium responders\/BP1\/real BP) as being at the most severe (dreaded!) end of the spectrum. The truth is that, psychosis or not, BP1 is one of the most treatable, if not the most treatable, mental health challenge there is. This is because Lithium is pure magic. Every few years I go off Lithium for 10-12 days just to remind myself. I wish I could communicate\\u00a0the majesty and horror of those experiences. It is humbling to know that even after having made a lifetime project\\u00a0of disciplining my mind, my carefully cultivated intellect will be swept away by mania and there is nothing I can do about it. The \\\"bipolar\\u00a0spectrum\\\" stigmatizes me, my friends, and my family. That stigma has had a corrosive and self-reinforcing impact on bipolar research. BP1 is incredibly treatable, but this fact is severely underemphasized because studies only recruit sick people. BP1 Lithium responders who have their shit together, like me\\u00a0+ my friends\\u00a0+ my family have no interest in study participation. This is because of 1) stigma 2) we don't need help or treatment which is often a perk of studies 3) $100 doesn't mean much to us\\u00a0+\\u00a0we don't possess an abundance of free time 4) not identifying with the specifics of the DSM when symptoms\\u00a0are many years in the rearview mirror 5) lack of faith in psychiatry as an institution because of its track record ie making homosexuality a disease etc. Although they are bought at a horrible cost, the creative gifts bestowed on Lithium responders are enormous\\u00a0and vastly underestimated in research. It is annoying to have paid so dearly and not have them recognized. Creativity doesn't mean anything if you aren't productive, you must have your shit together to be productive and if you have your shit together you don't participate in studies. I'm not worried though, I'm extremely optimistic about bipolar research. Incredible progress is being made in polygenic scoring for Lithiums responsiveness. Once we have a dependable, accessible\\u00a0genetic test for Lithium responsiveness\\u00a0\\\"bipolar spectrum\\\" will get swept into the dustbin where it belongs. Interventions drive categorization and a Lithium response genetic test would represent the most significant advance in mental health treatment we've seen in decades. Phenotypic description will take a backseat to genotype\\u00a0and my people will finally be on our way to getting the recognition we deserve.

quarantine and the covid-19 and IMAX so my oldest son is 10 and he has ADHD and three learning disabilities and is gifted and his school is has been up and running with e-learning pretty quickly since the quarantine started and my youngest son is 5 he is on the autism spectrum and he is in preschool and they are also offering e-learning I'm as well and so it has been a challenge temperature with both of them I'm also working from home and my husband is out of work and home kind of being the person to help with our kids and their school while I'm working so that we are all working together as a family to help her kids be successful I think for me one of the biggest things that has been a challenge isour younger son for sure he doesn't really like school to begin with has never really been a fan of going and so it's already been a challenge to get him to go but at least he was going and he was able to participate and most of the activities at school now that he's been home he has no interest in learning at all and for him School happens at school and play happy and it has been very difficult to make that transition for him my husband I've really been trying pretty hard everyday to get him to watch the videos that are being sent from high school and do the activities that are being sent and he doesn't have any interest in doing them and we've tried a handful of different strategies including visual schedules and person and reinforcers and I'm just picking their activities a little bit but it's not going so well so we're now I'm kind of starting over and thinking of Plan D I thinkwhich I think is probably going to consist of not doing any school activities from his school but just trying to do some of our own novel activities that he's not done before I'm hoping maybe that will help just to kind of keep the learning going but it's definitely been a challenge she's also super fixated on certain things and there's no distracting him they're all stuck in the house and there's nowhere to go and it's just been very very challenging so my older son has been a little less challenging but still challenges there too we just don't have the ability for one of us to sit with him one-on-one all day so we're kind of relying on his own concentration power and attention he thankfully does something's better on the computer which is good but he also gets distracted really easily and it's it's just been hard so he's not getting everything done that he needs to I'm only getting some of it soI'm grateful there's a lot of really thankful for that our school is providing opportunities for learning there's just a lot of pressure on us as parents while we're also trying to work maintain a household you know it make sure we have groceries and pay the bills and there's just a lot of pressure it's really stressful it's been a huge huge transition and you know I know there's a lot of things that are kind of going I'm done in terms of learning there's a lot of things that they're not doing that I really wish they were but I also find comfort in knowing that we're not alone. There's a lot of other people out there in the same boat people with neurotypical children and people with neurodiverse children that are may be struggling a little bit more so it's just helpful to know that we are experiencing this not in isolation even though we feel like we're in isolation and I hope that we will be able to recover and their children will be able to recover this last time in the floss killbut I'm sure we would really benefit from support I really I am providing Therapy Services cuz I'm a therapist electronically and I really wish that I had someone took to be that person for us because I feel like that would be really helpful but our service providers for our children are not able to provide that quite as much special for my youngest son during this time so anyways that's my thoughts and feelings I hope this helps thanks for giving me a platform to share our at my thoughts and yeah I want to thank you child MIND Institute for everything that you've done my oldest son has participated in your study and it was just a really positive experience for us thanks for your videos that are putting out the LA and just thanks for being there so thanks everyone teacher","user_id":null,"encrypted":1},{"id":234,"created_at":"2020-04-18 14:59:12","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:12","upload_id":470,"text":"hi I just wanted to share a little bit about some of my thoughts and feelings as a special needs parent during this time of quarantine and the covid-19 and IMAX so my oldest son is 10 and he has ADHD and three learning disabilities and is gifted and his school is has been up and running with e-learning pretty quickly since the quarantine started and my youngest son is 5 he is on the autism spectrum and he is in preschool and they are also offering e-learning I'm as well and so it has been a challenge temperature with both of them I'm also working from home and my husband is out of work and home kind of being the person to help with our kids and their school while I'm working so that we are all working together as a family to help her kids be successful I think for me one of the biggest things that has been a challenge isour younger son for sure he doesn't really like school to begin with has never really been a fan of going and so it's already been a challenge to get him to go but at least he was going and he was able to participate and most of the activities at school now that he's been home he has no interest in learning at all and for him School happens at school and play happy and it has been very difficult to make that transition for him my husband I've really been trying pretty hard everyday to get him to watch the videos that are being sent from high school and do the activities that are being sent and he doesn't have any interest in doing them and we've tried a handful of different strategies including visual schedules and person and reinforcers and I'm just picking their activities a little bit but it's not going so well so we're now I'm kind of starting over and thinking of Plan D I thinkwhich I think is probably going to consist of not doing any school activities from his school but just trying to do some of our own novel activities that he's not done before I'm hoping maybe that will help just to kind of keep the learning going but it's definitely been a challenge she's also super fixated on certain things and there's no distracting him they're all stuck in the house and there's nowhere to go and it's just been very very challenging so my older son has been a little less challenging but still challenges there too we just don't have the ability for one of us to sit with him one-on-one all day so we're kind of relying on his own concentration power and attention he thankfully does something's better on the computer which is good but he also gets distracted really easily and it's it's just been hard so he's not getting everything done that he needs to I'm only getting some of it soI'm grateful there's a lot of really thankful for that our school is providing opportunities for learning there's just a lot of pressure on us as parents while we're also trying to work maintain a household you know it make sure we have groceries and pay the bills and there's just a lot of pressure it's really stressful it's been a huge huge transition and you know I know there's a lot of things that are kind of going I'm done in terms of learning there's a lot of things that they're not doing that I really wish they were but I also find comfort in knowing that we're not alone.

the floss killbut I'm sure we would really benefit from support I really I am providing Therapy Services cuz I'm a therapist electronically and I really wish that I had someone took to be that person

that's my thoughts and feelings I hope this helps thanks for giving me a platform to share our at my thoughts and yeah I want to thank you child MIND Institute for everything that you've done my oldest son has participated in your study and it was just a really positive experience for us thanks for your videos that are putting out the LA and just thanks for being there so thanks everyone

out for her ADHD that helps regulate her her schedule is extremely important to her staying healthy and this is really thrownher for a loop her and her friends they've been really adaptive and

because she had a strong base in the strong network of friends and then they even expand that wall they have been in quarantine but just I know it's been a struggle for her it's not the same in addition she has a bunch of physical health problems so last year she was out for almost the entire school year having surgeries and recovering and so she lost her ninth-grade year and this is her 10th grade year and it seems to her and I would feel the same that is completely unfair that two years in a row her life was taken away from her she can't participate the way she wants to it's been also tough to manage a professional ballerina who goes from training 30 hours a week hard hard hard hard with extremely demanding teachers and and and inability to do it to nothing cuz they she can work in the homes you can work on our technique she doesn't absolutely amazing job motivating herself to do those things it's not the same as in person and just the other day about 2 days ago she really communicated that she was just sad little pure sadness that she was not going to go back to school and see and not having end of the year and I think that's related just to this year I don't even know if it's compounded by last year just she was having such a great life great time and to take to go from having like the time of your life living your fullest life as they say really doing is

at home now is to really even work from a trauma-informed perspective, developmental psychologists and I'm just thinking what we need to do is teach them to reconnect with her sense of agency to reconnect with their sense of control to help them kind of accelerate their identity process will they have this time to look inward think of who they are so that they have that strength to take with them when they come out of this is definitely a very difficult time and I don't think that parents have the time to deal with all of this right now and unfortunately you know it's the time when teenagers need their space very healthy space and to be in the pier world so that they can develop but they're with their parents and it's not that they don't love their parents just that they need to

isakova crisis has been both challenging and beneficial for a family the challenging pieces are the obvious being inside a lot more not having the same Outlets that we had before for exercise and social interaction and having to adjust that by finding rhythms that include a part time together on teaching our children had a social distance in those times I'm finding ways to exercise a new outlets for all of those needs other beneficial things have been that we have been together more we've had to work to conflict and we had more time to do that and ways that work constructive not being pressed to go to another activity or turn mother vent and that's been really great even though we have a lot of work to do inside her home with schooland just keeping the kids entertained they've learned to do a little bit and tell them we've also learned the necessity of taking time for alone time for each other and so those things have been really great at timers on it is hard feeling like groundhog day but and so the beneficial pieces are still great but we're just trying to think of it as a marathon and not a Sprint but those are basically where we're at and covet the pair in terms of the parents we've had to try to find ways to absorb the news and absorb what else is going on in the stresses of that in addition to just with the kids you know a parenting on top of parenting and on top of parenting in this new climate and that's been a difficult thing as we're all facing economic challenges food personally and just as a society not to mention just the bad news of a virus killing a lot of people and that's really hard and relatives being sickso I'm over all its there's been pluses and minuses but I feel like with God by God's grace we're surviving and we're thankful for that

have a son who's a first-year student at Elon University he's 18 years old and unfortunately he's home because of the virus and where I thought he would really be very upset because he was so incredibly involved with the school lots of friends a girlfriend he also did a lot of extracurricular activities as well as he has a job on campus for he is a tour guide but surprisingly he's been very dedicated to his studies he does his online courses he even goes the extra yard and learns additional things for school he's applying for a scholarship at the University and he still surprisingly getting paid by the university and doing virtual tours and so I think he's very pleased about that and he's actually surprisinglyreally being very productive and very positive during the day he does his school work and then in the evening we have dinner together as a family the two of us and we talked about our day because during the day we're sort of like two ships passing in the night I'm very busy with my illustration work and we doing to do list it'll knock your nose off and in the evening we get together and we talked about our day and that's been you know very nice she regularly runs now every day and then at the end of our dinner we sort of wrap it up and I'll get to my own things and walk the dog in that sort of thing and he gets on the phone with all of his Elon college friends and I can hear him just laughing and having a great time for hours on end in a while I'm going to bed in the evening so I would saysurprisingly he's doing very well he does not see an end of this in anytime which is unfortunate I think he does have a lot of remorse as to his first year of college and all the parties and dances that we're going to happen this spring and sporting events and just all of these wonderful opportunities that are now lost but you know he is making the best of it and in fact per his request through taking a drive into Manhattan and we're going to the rockaways and we're going all over just to see how desolate area is and unlike some of his friends were I've heard that kind of snuck out of the house to go do things with their friends he's been exceptional at Social distancing and taking it all very seriouslyand that's it he also has his regular therapy sessions with his therapist but via I guess phone conversation so that's every other week cuz there's not a lot happening and so he's keeping up with his mental health and yeah I just I just really hope he and his friends and all these kids can get back to school in the fall I think we're adults like myself I think we can pretty much cope and manage very well I think it's a real great Interruption and young people's lives and yeah I guess that's it always is pretty well and making the best of a bad situation isn't it thanks","user_id":153,"encrypted":1},{"id":252,"created_at":"2020-04-18 19:00:59","updated_at":"2020-08-03

introvert a little a little fatter try to keep her active I got to go outside to walk the dog and do things like that keep her active in the house but if there's only so much you can do with teenagers teenagers are very different than having like four year old running around a teenager like that closeness with their friends you know even if Dad joking around and doing absolutely on the way home from school and then think knowing that the summer also and program even harder still thought of it but hopefully it won't take a toll of my child mentally cuz that is I think it's on myself and watching her go through certain changes we'll see how things go and hopefully in the future you know we can get out of this with nobody being sick and you know so far we've been lucky and black

home maybe twice a week every day for six days at 6 weeks if that's difficult communicating it's it's just it's a very hard thing but I think it's been harder on my teenage daughter more she's more seems more secluded now and not as happy and I have to go outside and walk the dog occasionally so she can get fresh air and feel like she's able to do something I encouraged her to work but everyone needs some physical contact just to be around people I mean it's just nature but will hopefully get well soon and hopefully everything will be back to normal again hopefully everyone can stay healthy

top of this and he does not has no idea what he's doing and because of that license in lost and I think that they're going to try to use this and this is a big fear of mine as a way to steal the election and try to stifle votes in and shut down voices and stillstill votes and so I think that if he keep our eyes open and make sure that we don't let this pandemic be a tool for a toy corrupt government to steal the election I think that's one of my biggest fears I think that we have to be diligent about the way that we're handling this right now known as a way to survive this was a way to prepare for other crisis in the future that wouldn't they come up we are or more prepared for what will happen cuz he will come up against the school just won't be the last time and so how we handle it now and the way that we take steps towards addressing it and handling is supporting our citizens and each other will be set a precedence for what was in the future not an important part of what happened to your so it's not just about going to beach with the governor of Florida or can't you help quickly to do get back to work can we set the steps that next time this happens to it will happen again there where she will handle more efficiency so it's not about what happens now economically or with with people jobs and with people's livelihoods and I'll tell you when this happened Who's online we have jobs that can be done from from from home we have an adequate food supply in PPE for the workers and we have all these things in place so that when it happened to do it won't it won't

too much on the news or social media because that does anxiety and fear but I've been very fortunate so I haven't had too much fear anxiety and when it has popped up I think what's been working for me the most is just dealing withmy breath and thinking about my breath as much as possible trying to bring myself back to the moment actually that's more than just whenever I fear or anxiety or any of that creeping up I just come back to wherever I am in the moment and remember that that fear and anxiety is because I'm thinking about you chart and not what is happening right now in this moment and

they were friends before they had to go into quarantine and they have found a way to interact online that where they have their fun at night and I think that our is really nice that they have social media to do that and then one a few nights ago I said you know you guys can just keep playing goofing around and kind of like play fighting with one another to keep yourself busy and not bored even though you're having a fun time I just thought you know there was a recipe for disaster possibly coming and so my daughter woke up this morning and she has been like that again having fun at night and there's lots of giggles and I really think laughter is the best thing for them in terms of keeping their mental health up so then today she said this afternoon she's like I'm going to prepare for tonight cuz we're going to have a debate at 9:30 and ask what what she means and she said that you know there are nine of them like 9 or four friends are getting together to have a debate about abortion so they're there 15 and 16 year old and I think sometimes we think that they're always just doing like goofy stuff and they don't really you know like they're just on social media and they're wasting their time I was just really impressed and then she spent the day putting together her talking points and we discussed you know where she's in the bed and I was talking to her about you know the rules of debate and you know play procedure has I'm just I thought it was just such a nice sweet story that these 15 16 year olds are getting together to do something the end there and they're very excited about it and no adult was involved they decided to do it on their own so I'm looking forward to how they have how they how they experienced it and I just wanted to share that it was a

know I was really worried that was my United States so before the last week of February I made Costco runs at Wegmans multiple times got toilet paper and disinfectant and all kinds of things like that to try to really be prepared for a crisis and then basically by the 14th of March II was just like you know what we're leaving the city it was interesting because it's literally that. Is the week then that my office shut down my daughter's school closed and we came to Pennsylvania to stay with family and we've been here now for about 5 weeks I guess if you're crazy like we left the city and live somewhere totally different is kind of how it feels thankfully my in-laws in Pennsylvania have a separate carriage house that we can stay in and you know it's a little bit like glamping it's not fully you know our home but it doesn't have a working stove but bathrooms in microwave and so it's been fine and it's been great to honestly have space to let our daughter run around in and to havetwo extra people in the mix for us to share the responsibility of our two kids cuz we have a six month old and a seven year old so that's been really really helpful you know sharing meals and and just responsibilities my husband is doing distance learning for our daughter all day as well as taking care of my son you've lost all of his work which is really challenging but at least that's allowing him the time to be able to take care of the kids and while I'm working remotely like 9 hours solid today and it's kind of intense but it has at least I feel very very grateful that I have a job and that we have health insurance and that we can be away from the city and just you know kind of get fresh air if we need it outside although I'm literally locked inside kind of all day feels like and I haven't been able to like see my family more we actually have started talking my family that lives far away we've been doing Facebook chats and things like that which is really great and I

going on no actually he is rebelling still but not as much as he used to and and we're fine we're we're here in New York City we we have each other we have enough food in the fridge and I still have a job which is more thanturn off 25 million Americans can say right now maybe even more than that that's just to apply for unemployment what about all those people that couldn't write that have jobs where you don't get paid on the books on so it's probably more like I don't know 30 35 40 million people right now who are wondering how to put it together so so we're fine but but there's been an emotional toll for sure a psychic Mills actually is probably doing the best of all of us he prefers going to school on his computer he prefers interacting with the world Visa be the reason to be the protection of a computer I guess because it makes me feel saferand I don't know maybe for my wife it's not that much different because some she was she's freelancing she was out of it didn't have any gigs for the last little while so so for her this is kind of maybe with the exception of having a mask up and do you know if he will be all careful when you go out or whatever and limit your time's going out I've made a huge transition I teach in a public school out in Jamaica Queens 3500 kids theater teacher all my classes are super physical right acting building sets dark as well so this is also something that's really hard to do online especially when our population struggles with them maybe having the resources to have the technology at home or the connections to the internet if they have those they're often sharing them amongst a lot of people their space compromise their food compromised you know there's there's just a lot of issues I think right now I'm having about 50 to 75% lion with regard to my online lessons I've been focusing most of mine around how do you feel about this like what you guys are doing right now with this basically I'm having my kids right about that free videos about it flipgrid that site for Education where you allow kids to make videos back and forth with each other and end for me to make videos for that like that's ever been a really pretty good thing for some of my students yeah I think a lot of my peers are struggling as well to to be relevant and to be helpful in this time and I did fulfill our mission right which is to educate these kids to a standard National Standard that's Based on data and numbers and Mastery of standardized tests which in and of itself as a whole bailiwick of problems that's not the right word as a Wrath of issues that I that I could bring up about it but you know in the end we're really just trying to do the same thing we've always done was get kids to think critically on Fit Kids to believe in themselves get kids to solve problems and get to trust their own experience as their best teacher and to prepare them to go out into the world and make their way so sorry I'm trying that but it's really hard poetry is helped me a lot I know that sounds really stupid but I wrote a poem for NPR you could check it out it's called the row row on WNYC play that are on the are a couple days ago as part of their National poetry month thing the theme was calls out what a difference a month makes I guess that's all.

interaction that he gets at school so he the school closure has really been hard for him because that was really his only social outlet he would go to school he would see you know his friends and they would have that camaraderie and you know that he would come home and do his homework and you know just going to crawl back into his shell so not having that routine of school going to school and seeing his friends he's not very good at reaching out to them proactively for example texting them or God forbid FaceTiming them like that so he really has been a recluse since schools closed and yeah and I think that this is definitely having some mental health impacts you know he's feeling lonely isolated he's not one that really shares his feelings but I can just kind of tell from his body language is demeanor that is really not enjoying this and as a result of covid-19 he's on the screen I mean I don't know 14 hours a day doing homework lots of distractions of YouTube video games so basically he gets a bee gets on the screen and then he gets off the screen then goes to that that's his life so it's been pretty pretty hard for a teenager as adults I feel like we can self-regulate and see you know like for us all to go out get exercise etc etc but for him you know he's kind of been in this just the screen Zone and with no social contact so anyway that was my feedback that I

not caring you know what I mean there's landscapers outside my house now for in the truck you know cleaning the neighbor's yard nomaste and we're at April 25th so that's not supposed to be and it's real difficult for children to see that and I understand that you know we have to worry about ourselves but the larger point of this is everyone supposed to be caring about others and wearing masks and PPE to protect others and that's very difficult to see so many people unwilling to do that and then it's the most difficult time we've had with it it's been great seeing my son learn things at school and be more involved in what he's doing although I wish the school had more structure provided and that's difficult for me because I see other districts to have that and that's

never ready I mean he stoled witness but at least you don't have the pressure of having to make it to the school bus and then in terms of like socializing that was a very challenging for having school so although he missesbeing in school and seeing friends cuz none of that life daily fighting and you're not having to struggle social skills and that situation so in a way it's been a lot less

attention that she requires and deserves because I'm also working from home just left to her own devices and which is you know not horrible but she's already struggling to stay focused on school and when school is remote via the Internet and she has no one to stand over her shoulder and make sure she's engaging she doesn't and I'm worried about her academic achievement and continued development of persistent sore stick-to-itiveness I guess I'm also worried about her relationship with her peers because she can't see them in person she does do some FaceTime chats or you know plays games online with them but it's different than spending time in person and that I think what happened in fact and then ultimately I feel like this whole crisis has demonstrated the lack of commitment that American society has towards families and supporting I mean social safety nine you know so many challenges that you know I feel lucky enough to dodge many of them but it's really highlighted that for me and

cheering on our essential workers are our doctors and nurses and grocery store workers and everybody that's got to go to work and how appreciated that they are at this point in time I've settled into staying home life my life the pace of my life has slowed down considerably and I'm actually not as worried as I was in the beginning we have sound of a good routine here at home our son is taken to learning online pretty well as long as we stay on top of themit's nice having all of us at home together since prior to this we really didn't see one another all that much except that night and you know on the weekends usually I was running around food shopping and stuff so currently I'm not that worried and I think that our son is feeling a little bit better he's probably more annoyed than haven't you know having us around as much as we are so he doesn't have quite so much alone timeanyway I'll come back and record more as time goes by adjust if I had any sort of here right now it just

recording my fears frustrations and needs right now as well as what's been helping get through this crisis it's April 27th my grandmother died of the virus exactly a week ago from today time she was quite old and not well but not being able to be with her at the end or hold her hand could really see us so we would talk to her and hold her hands so she could find us find our voices instead she was alone in a dark room for the last month 6 weeks whatever it was really six seven weeks of her life alone in a room and then she got sick or she tested positive luckily she never got incredibly sick so there is a blessing in that she was just frail and old the weekend of a funeral luckily my children did get to very quickly going to the funeral parlor and Say Goodbye during her virtual week so they at least can kind of understand some of what was happening but it's definitely not anything you'd ever expect not to be able to like Barry the people you love no matter what how much is time in okay and you've made peace with a long beautiful life can't bury them you can't have a funeral can't go to church so I don't really know I have so many fears about my children not exercising not moving not going outside it's been raining for weeks it's freezing by New York City so cold and wet and gross it's really draining EXO many fears about their health and their activity of their brains because they're not getting activity their brains on those machines of games in the machines all day so frustrated with my spouse never ending fighting never-ending fighting I can't keep up with anything I am always kind I say I'm failing quarantine apparently I'm not supposed to say I stale quarantine how can you fail like there are no rules but it really feels like I'm doing it all worse than other people so that stinks I don't like getting F's on her report card so I don't know I have some friends so I would that I get a lot of laughter from there helping a blessing has been connecting with people who I haven't seen in years or talked to in a regular basis and now like fight we have the time and we have the motivation and it's like actually like the most fun is having Zoom calls with them and FaceTime chats so that that has been special that has been an interesting blessing and unexpected silver lining and I don't really know what else I don't know what my needs are I don't know I saw that everyday feels like a full are my little one asked the other day he said what day is it said Tuesday said Mama are there even such things as Fridays anymore and I said I don't even know if it's like I don't even know it's very young it's a very unknown time and both my two oldest kids will have their birthdays in quarantine next week they're kind of big I mean their kids but they're still bigger Milestone birthdays and it stinks really stinks and I have fear that no one will come up for their show up for their car parade and no one will care and they don't like they have they

speak also as a parent I have one son and University who had to come home to The Cove in so his university wasn't for that much longer so he accused in Computing science so it was sort of a natural I think shift but he's he found it quite hard to learn such a technical stuff without a teacher right there and without the classmates and he did it but I think it took a little extra effort and right now he's done all his exams so I'm very proud of him she finished it Choice one more year so I'm not sure what next year will look like and it's kind of disappointing kind of a no closure ending in a way to it just sort of ended and then come home and get all this stuff and stressful but doable and not that big a deal depends on if it goes all next year I think that would be a whole other thing that will have to deal with then I have two other kids in school one is in high school grade 11 she kind of has special needs and it's been we were at the point honestly of pulling her out and doing online school anyways to be honest it kind of worked out in her favor but then we realized we have sit with her and actually make sure she does everything and like yeah my husband is actually better at that than I am and I feel like I burned out just trying to get her to go to school for so many years but you know hopefully this is the way that she can learn and even if it goes next year it would be nice if she had a grad next year at the end and she misses her friends a little bit but she didn't really have that many friends so anyway it's okay my son who is in Grade 9 he's also quite an introvert and she was developing a sensitivity to lots of chewing sounds and stuff and he was getting a lot of anxiety in a wave by being at school a lot of annoyance with his classmates cuz he's been with them for a long time it's a small school so honestly for him he's loving it he loves his free time he hangs out with his big brother who is home from college and so far honestly it seems not bad for my point of view he's doing great he's self-motivated he's doing it he's doing well he was an a student I think he likes the efficiency of it and he's hoping to go to a big high school next year so that could be a bigger let down I think if you can't do that but we'll get there when we get there and yeah I think for me it's sad that there's no graduation from Grade 9 that's my last child so that's a little bit of a lack of closure again but she's happy so I'm happy as well so that it's not been that bad my husband's also check he kind of guy so he was able to fix up our internet to be better and we had to do a lot of rearranging around the house to make sure everyone had a good space and that they weren't beside someone who is annoying them and I didn't want any computers in their bedroom so we managed. But it took a bit of effort was a little stressful and we have to do it all pretty quickly and you can't really go shopping and so that was a bit of a challenge and I'm having a hard time actually getting them to do exercise or you know get up on time I've had to be really flexible and let them work in their pajamas and just let them like figure it out and I think it's been realistic expectations on them now so it's an adjustment.

that this time we'll end at some given point and then I wish that I have done something war of Wednesday or the other and will probably beat myself up about the fact that I probably didn't do as much as I wanted to buthoping to at least take advantage of the time that we have now that is extended that we don't normally get to enjoy time together as well so that's really about

education is being done through text message or through I'm just watching the video that is nothing that can replace that interaction between the teacher and student in our kids I feel are going to be lost I'm alsoturn to that even if we don't go back this year and September rolls around once we're back in school setting and Society opened up again I'm concerned looking at history with other pandemics there's going to be another wave and we're going to be closed down again and what's going to happen to the children who lived during this. Of time and their education and their development I I feel they're just going to be so far behind with it so in many ways I I think they're going to suffer educationally I think emotionally I can't

basically there you used to go to the park zoo zoos and museums Children's Museums samsara Villages homes and stuff like that we're doing none of that none of that and I worry that my oldest getting used to it like I said I'm worried for her mental health and her behavior which was already bad right before schools closed it was already terrible and I was going to seek more help for that she's going to get re-evaluated and all of that was put on the backburner there were talks about sending her maybe to a different school and looking into that school that will that will know how to harness your creativity but I don't know everything is just up in the air I'm very grateful I am still working I have a source of income very grateful no one in my immediate family has gotten sick I'm grateful for the extra time with my family but I'm scared for the future because we don't know what to expect if this comes back harder in the fall in the second wave what does this mean for Life next

but we're really really important to me my Rabbi you know some I know quite a few other people that we report you know that I knew well you know what close family friend it's been really really really difficult you know my kids have had a difficult time my daughter keeps escaping into I'm talking worldwide Lord of the Rings she's probably spend the majority of her date thinking about that she's not answering you know Zoom classes because whenever I think she starts feeling a little anxious she automatically beers to you know her fantasy world the Lord of the Rings and she's been spending time doing that it's up in a really really hard to figure out how do you know there are so many places that are giving you know schools that are offering anybody can come pick up food were quarantined I'm not able to go out and because I'm going to compromise as a chance I could get it again so it's not really good idea for my kids to go out too so trying to figure out how to get stuff into the house has been you know really really really challenging I haven't got paid from work so that's another challenge thank God utilities are not turning off right being really serious trouble you know what helps a lot I I keep a journal a lot of humor in there and a lot of very intense emotion which is really really helpful helps to reach out to friends and family, I videotape a read-aloud everyday and send it out to all the kids are each state chapter day which means you know send them to suppose things kind of keep me going I've been I love to cook and just the last few days I felt strong enough to start doing that a little bit which is great and it's just great to see all the altruism out there and you know how people help each other on this has been a tough time but one that I'll never forget","user_id":null,"encrypted":1},{"id":427,"created_at":"2020-05-01 18:32:51","updated_at":"2020-08-03

several comments and suggestions and I think now that the nightmares were caused by having the room too warm when I slept I was responding to messages about warmth and humidity being good for discouraging the virus so now I seem to have that problem licked and it had nothing nothing more complicated than cooling off the room nightmares have been the worst part of this for me I posted to a face group Facebook group asking for pictures of the view from my window and this may this group meets regularly and post views of what they see out their window and then has some comments I posted the view out my window which is a trash can I said a little something about how this view is one view of the one window from the guest room is special and wonderful to me because it means I'm with

have a son who's a first-year student at Elon University he's 18 years old and unfortunately he's home because of the virus and where I thought he would really be very upset because he was so incredibly involved with the school lots of friends a girlfriend he also did a lot of extracurricular activities as well as he has a job on campus for he is a tour guide but surprisingly he's been very dedicated to his studies he does his online courses he even goes the extra yard and learns additional things for school he's applying for a scholarship at the University and he still surprisingly getting paid by the university and doing virtual tours and so I think he's very pleased about that and he's actually surprisinglyreally being very productive and very positive during the day he does his school work and then in the evening we have dinner together as a family the two of us and we talked about our day because during the day we're sort of like two ships passing in the night I'm very busy with my illustration work and we doing to do list it'll knock your nose off and so in the evening we get together and we talked about our day and that's been you know very nice she regularly runs now every day and then at the end of our dinner we sort of wrap it up and I'll get to my own things and walk the dog in that sort of thing and he gets on the phone with all of his Elon college friends and I can hear him just laughing and having a great time for hours on end in a while I'm going to bed in the evening so I would saysurprisingly he's doing very well he does not see an end of this in anytime which is unfortunate I think he does have a lot of remorse as to his first year of college and all the parties and dances that we're going to happen this spring and sporting events and just all of these wonderful opportunities that are now lost but you know he is making the best of it and in fact per his request through taking a drive into Manhattan and we're going to the rockaways and we're going all over just to see how desolate area is and unlike some of his friends were I've heard that kind of snuck out of the house to go do things with their friends he's been exceptional at Social distancing and taking it all very seriouslyand that's it he also has his regular therapy sessions with his therapist but via I guess phone conversation so that's every other week cuz there's not a lot happening and so he's keeping up with his mental health and yeah I just I just really hope he and his friends and all these kids can get back to school in the fall I think we're adults like myself I think we can pretty much cope and manage very well I think it's a real great Interruption and young people's lives and yeah I guess that's it always is pretty well and making the best of a bad situation isn't it thanks","user_id":null,"encrypted":1},{"id":655,"created_at":"2020-05-09 05:25:14","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:13","upload_id":469,"text":"hi I just wanted to share a little bit about some of my thoughts and feelings as a special needs parent during this time of quarantine and the covid-19 and IMAX so my oldest son is 10 and he has ADHD and three learning disabilities and is gifted and his school is has been up and running with e-learning pretty quickly since the quarantine started and my youngest son is 5 he is on the autism spectrum and he is in preschool and they are also offering e-learning I'm as well and so it has been a challenge temperature with both of them I'm also working from home and my husband is out of work and home kind of being the person to help with our kids and their school while I'm working so that we are all working together as a family to help her kids be successful I think for me one of the biggest things that has been a challenge isour younger son for sure he doesn't really like school to begin with has never really been a fan of going and so it's already been a challenge to get him to go but at least he was going and he was able to participate and most of the activities at school now that he's been home he has no interest in learning at all and for him School happens at school and play happy and it has been very difficult to make that transition for him my husband I've really been trying pretty hard everyday to get him to watch the videos that are being sent from high school and do the activities that are being sent and he doesn't have any interest in doing them and we've tried a handful of different strategies including visual schedules and person and reinforcers and I'm just picking their activities a little bit but it's not going so well so we're now I'm kind of starting over and thinking of Plan D I thinkwhich I think is probably going to consist of not doing any school activities from his school but just trying to do some of our own novel activities that he's not done before I'm hoping maybe that will help just to kind of keep the learning going but it's definitely been a challenge she's also super fixated on certain things and there's no distracting him they're all stuck in the house and there's nowhere to go and it's just been very very challenging so my older son has been a little less challenging but still challenges there too we just don't have the ability for one of us to sit with him one-on-one all day so we're kind of relying on his own concentration power and attention he thankfully does something's better on the computer which is good but he also gets distracted really easily and it's it's just been hard so he's not getting everything done that he needs to I'm only getting some of it soI'm grateful there's a lot of really thankful for that our school is providing opportunities for learning there's just a lot of pressure on us as parents while we're also trying to work maintain a household you know it make sure we have groceries and pay the bills and there's just a lot of pressure it's really stressful it's been a huge huge transition and you know I know there's a lot of things that are kind of going I'm done in terms of learning there's a lot of things that they're not doing that I really wish they were but I also find comfort in knowing that we're not alone. There's a lot of other people out there in the same boat people with neurotypical children and people with neurodiverse children that are may be struggling a little bit more so it's just helpful to know that we are experiencing this not in isolation even though we feel like we're in isolation and I hope that we will be able to recover and their children will be able to recover this last time in the floss killbut I'm sure we would really benefit from support I really I am providing Therapy Services cuz I'm a therapist electronically and I really wish that I had someone took to be that person for us because I feel like that would be really helpful but our service providers for our children are not able to provide that quite as much special for my youngest son during this time so anyways that's my thoughts and feelings I hope this helps thanks for giving me a platform to share our at my thoughts and yeah I want to thank you child MIND Institute for everything that you've done my oldest son has participated in your study and it was just a really positive experience for us thanks for your videos that are putting out the LA and just thanks for being there so thanks everyone teacher","user_id":null,"encrypted":1},{"id":656,"created_at":"2020-05-09 05:25:15","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:13","upload_id":581,"text":"","user_id":null,"encrypted":1},{"id":657,"created_at":"2020-05-09 05:25:16","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:13","upload_id":471,"text":"hi I just wanted to share a little bit about some of my thoughts and feelings as a special needs parent during this time of quarantine and the covid-19 and IMAX so my oldest son is 10 and he has ADHD and three learning disabilities and is gifted and his school is has been up and running with e-learning pretty quickly since the quarantine started and my youngest son is 5 he is on the autism spectrum and he is in preschool and they are also offering e-learning I'm as well and so it has been a challenge temperature with both of them I'm also working from home and my husband is out of work and home kind of being the person to help with our kids and their school while I'm working so that we are all working together as a family to help her kids be successful I think for me one of the biggest things that has been a challenge isour younger son for sure he doesn't really like school to begin with has never really been a fan of going and so it's already been a challenge to get him to go but at least he was going and he was able to participate and most of the activities at school now that he's been home he has no interest in learning at all and for him School happens at school and play happy and it has been very difficult to make that transition for him my husband I've really been trying pretty hard everyday to get him to watch the videos that are being sent from high school and do the activities that are being sent and he doesn't have any interest in doing them and we've tried a handful of different strategies including visual schedules and person and reinforcers and I'm just picking their activities a little bit but it's not going so well so we're now I'm kind of starting over and thinking of Plan D I thinkwhich I think is probably going to consist of not doing any school activities from his school but just trying to do some of our own novel activities that he's not done before I'm hoping maybe that will help just to kind of keep the learning going but it's definitely been a challenge she's also super fixated on certain things and there's no distracting him they're all stuck in the house and there's nowhere to go and it's just been very very challenging so my older son has been a little less challenging but still challenges there too we just don't have the ability for one of us to sit with him one-on-one all day so we're kind of relying on his own concentration power and attention he thankfully does something's better on the computer which is good but he also gets distracted really easily and it's it's just been hard so he's not getting everything done that he needs to I'm only getting some of it soI'm grateful there's a lot of really thankful for that our school is providing opportunities for learning there's just a lot of pressure on us as parents while we're also trying to work maintain a household you know it make sure we have groceries and pay the bills and there's just a lot of pressure it's really stressful it's been a huge huge transition and you know I know there's a lot of things that are kind of going I'm done in terms of learning there's a lot of things that they're not doing that I really wish they were but I also find comfort in knowing that we're not alone.

here in New York City we we have each other we have enough food in the fridge and I still have a job which is more thanturn off 25 million Americans can say right now maybe even more than that that's just to apply for unemployment what about all those people that couldn't write that have jobs where you don't get paid on the books on so it's probably more like I don't know 30 35 40 million people right now who are wondering how to put it together so so we're fine but but there's been an emotional toll for sure a psychic Mills actually is probably doing the best of all of us he prefers going to school on his computer he prefers interacting with the world Visa be the reason to be the protection of a computer I guess because it makes me feel saferand I don't know maybe for my wife it's not that much different because some she was she's freelancing she was out of it didn't have any gigs for the last little while so so for her this is kind of maybe with the exception of having a mask up and do you know if he will be all careful when you go out or whatever and limit your time's going out I've made a huge transition I teach in a public school out in Jamaica Queens 3500 kids theater teacher all my classes are super physical right acting building sets dark as well so this is also something that's really hard to do online especially when our population struggles with them maybe having the resources to have the technology at home or the connections to the internet if they have those they're often sharing them amongst a lot of people their space compromise their food compromised you know there's there's just a lot of issues I think right now I'm having about 50 to 75% lion with regard to my online lessons I've been focusing most of mine around how do you feel about this like what you guys are doing right now with this basically I'm having my kids right about that free videos about it flipgrid that site for Education where you allow kids to make videos back and forth with each other and end for me to make videos for that like that's ever been a really pretty good thing for some of my students yeah I think a lot of my peers are struggling as well to to be relevant and to be helpful in this time and I did fulfill our mission right which is to educate these kids to a standard National Standard that's Based on data and numbers and Mastery of standardized tests which in and of itself as a whole bailiwick of problems that's not the right word as a Wrath of issues that I that I could bring up about it but you know in the end we're really just trying to do the same thing we've always done was get kids to think critically on Fit Kids to believe in themselves get kids to solve problems and get to trust their own experience as their best teacher and to prepare them to go out into the world and make their way so sorry I'm trying that but it's really hard poetry is helped me a lot I know that sounds really stupid but I wrote a poem for NPR you could check it out it's called the row row on WNYC play that are on the are a couple days ago as part of their National poetry month thing the theme was calls out what a difference a month makes I guess

feel like I can't give her the attention that she requires and deserves because I'm also working from home just left to her own devices and which is you know not horrible but she's already struggling to stay focused on school and when school is remote via the Internet and she has no one to stand over her shoulder and make sure she's engaging she doesn't and I'm worried about her academic achievement and continued development of persistent sore stick-to-itiveness I guess I'm also worried about her relationship with her peers because she can't see them in person she does do some FaceTime chats or you know plays games online with them but it's different than spending time in person and that I think what happened in fact and then ultimately I feel like this whole crisis has demonstrated the lack of commitment that American society has towards families and supporting I mean social safety nine you know so many challenges that you know I feel lucky enough to dodge many of

working with my kids school being on conferences with their parents attending meetings doing virtual counseling sessions 3:34 comes and I have to turn that off and turn on mom role because my kids my 5th grader and high school student need guidance being in the education field one of the frustrating things is that so much of the education is being done through text message or through I'm just watching the video that is nothing that can replace that interaction between the teacher and student in our kids I feel are going to be lost I'm alsoturn to that even if we don't go back this year and September rolls around once we're back in school setting and Society opened up again I'm concerned looking at history with other pandemics there's going to be another wave and we're going to be closed down again and what's going to happen to the children who lived during this. Of time and their education and their development I I feel they're just going to be so far behind with it so in many ways I I think they're going to suffer educationally I think emotionally I can't even imagine the amount of Crisis counseling when I get back to work how much PTSD we're going to start seeing so it's a scary time and none of us are quite sure how this is going to turn out once

new stressors in many ways I think it's more stressful than working in a school social worker so I spend all day on meetings with parents reaching out and do counseling sessions with kids just doing basic case management staff andit it's taking me so much longer to get through that then if I was in actually in work so after putting in more than my regularly scheduled school day I then turn it off and need to go back to being a parent and as a parent my kids are getting video lessons and educated online but then there are also left to their own devices for much of it so when I turn off my school day I start their school day so my evenings are now a friend doing we're redoing work with a 5th grader and a high school student and it just really makes me concerned what's going to happen to those students whose parents don't have the ability to help them where are working on our front lines and coming home exhausted and just can't do this stuffwhen Society opens again it's it's nobody quite knows what the new normal is there such a word as going to be how much of our Lives will go back to being the same how much is going to be changed how much PTSD are we going to see in our kids

before you realize that the thing to which are responding was not real not substantially real each nightmare seem to get worse I started with mudslides then came the Holocaust torturing a mass

suggestions and I think now that the nightmares were caused by having the room too warm when I slept I was responding to messages about warmth and humidity being good for discouraging the virus so now I seem to have that problem licked and it had nothing nothing more complicated than cooling off the room nightmares have been the worst part of this for me I posted to a face group Facebook group asking for pictures of the view from my window and this may this group meets regularly and post views of what they see out their window and then has some comments I posted the view out my window which is a trash can I said a little something about how this view is one view of the one window from the guest room is special and wonderful to me because it means I'm with family my response got to six and a half thousand likes and about 500 or more comments from all around the world and they were all very positive and supporting none of the spam or personal attacks that's the first time in my

going to the store or just going to the library or even the park or you know you're even bigger outings like no chill no kill children's museum near the Aquarium here you know how much I relied on giving them novel experiences as well as preschool I know they went to preschool my two older ones ones preschool three days a week and I feel like that was good for their Social Development so it all kind of Falls to me and I've been worrying about kind of their Social Development which I feel is so important right now I don't really worry about the academic so much cuz I feel like that will that will comebut you know parenting 24-hours is really hard my baby still gets up quite a bit at night and my husband is worse than medicine so he's gone from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. everyday and he's being Zapped when he gets home and I was apps cuz I got somebody up from you know 5 a.m. until 9 p.m. and then watching the baby so it's um you know and I realize how much those excursions to kind ofhelped me just to not feel so so burnt out and just to increase everybody's mood so I haven't really talked to them very much about what's going on or in a really try to put that that pressure on them not really pressure but just kind of those big feelings that I have about the crisis even though I you know they say they miss their friends and you know before it's interesting before my my four-year-old would have her imaginary play and she would be you know at the star Kingdom or the Rainbow Kingdom or she'd be on mars or something and this fantastic worlds that she would just imagine herself into but but now and she kind of imagines her play it's she's putting herself in you know Costco and she's putting herself at school with her friends or you know these really kind of you know Monday and everyday places that we really took for granted but it's hard it's it's very emotionally and physically and mentally draining and my husband was like you know people did this before I can do women stay at home with their kids but you know but not like this I mean you could go to the store too kind of break up the day you could take him to a park to break up the day I mean you didn't have to really worried about that kind of stuff so it is nice I think at first the pace was nice to not have to run them around their feel like I had to run them around and just kind of connecting back to staying at home and being okay with being at home and my only goal now is just to have give them a good day but it is getting monotonous though it's just more about trying to find them some novel experiences because we're just kind of in this for the Long Haul and I'm not sure when it's going to end but but it is I feel lucky that my only job right now is to hang out with my kids but so is sometimes I do feel guilty about going to being a little bit burnt out but you know I'm with the worried that I have for my husband working in healthcare in and do you know the second wave and when is life going to kind of get back to the place that we can just going to do family outings or you know not worry too much about it so that's just kind of my my issue and how things have

really interesting I think it's been very challenging from the standpoint of disrupting the say over also to structure of the family lice and I think that that's a really interesting thing to look at because I'm you know I think there's some good things that have come out of it in terms of really looking at how we do school and the way we should have over schedule our children and just the general resources we have in place to sort of deal with with some of the challenges of of educating our kids and and and dealing with mental health issues with children so I think what's happened is in a sort of the general that the basic structures went away and as parents we were faced with this this kind of hot how do we you know you would become homeschooling parents in are we now the teachers I think there was just a lot of unsure Ness about how to deal with this from that perspective I think also in our children's entire social life was now like the way and we became the ones to have to support all their needs in that way as well and I'll and it brought him lots of challenges I think every one of our kids has suffered some mental health issues because of this and they've all man has fell manifest themselves in different ways are somewhere one of our kids really it went into anger and Science and to the point of just not willing to do anything throwing things hurting you know sort of like punching us than me or just being very very physically aggressive and angry another just drove into deep depression and insecurities about yourself you know anything in the world anyone really like to see all these sort of normal sort of high school insecurities were just exacerbated by not being able to have any contact with people sound like video conferences and being isolated in his room or in a room and then my daughter manifest itself and just sort of extreme irritability and just at the drop of a hat just kind of you know having a meltdown you know your old style meltdown but she's not so sure her age also in a text Rena of a stream of sessions about how she look not wanting to appear on video you know I'm sudden concerns about her weight concerns about her appearance I do think was brought on somebody her age but somebody just this need to be on camera all the time but these meetings and just the sort of distance between it's created between doing everything virtually versus actually being in the same room as people and then it's all been cooped up in the same household and having to deal with each other and having to just let go of the Perfection of you know work is work and home is home like working home became sort of the mash together and you know being on call for work with your kids sort of needing something and bugging you and you know it it just it just was not worth it just couldn't be as pretty as you can make it you know when when there's a real clear separation between the work environment in the home environment but some of that was freeing just letting it go let it realizing that everyone was in the same boat or not everyone but a lot of people were in the same boat so I feel like I became more accepting of people who had other challenges due to this and I feel like became more accepting of myself that things weren't going to look as button up as maybe they would otherwise and then I think all our kids have slowly learn to just be more self-sufficient the computer skills to the Moon","user_id":354,"encrypted":1},{"id":5029,"created_at":"2020-06-17 09:15:19","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","upload_id":5571,"text":"1 2 3 4 5

and about but we do try to get out everyday we would go free their wokery we just got a bike and some now car going biking some really I feel like it's a necessity for him and it's worth taking the risks of stepping outside but it's beyond challenging and it's really scary and I hope every day for a cure or vaccine to come until then we just you know for the most part we had left the only thing we can do is be helpful so it's some hopefully this will pass","user_id":358,"encrypted":1},{"id":5043,"created_at":"2020-06-29 18:21:01","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","upload_id":5597,"text":" I

and it looks like I'm going to be doing most if not all of the semester remotely my campus has opened a little bit so the classes that are smaller are going to be in person but I'm not thinking that I'm going to do any of those because my dad has underlying health conditions and I obviously don't want to bring anything back to him so it looks like I'm going to be staying at home for the next semester probably the next year and you know I kind of had to come to terms with that and come to terms with the fact that I am probably not going to have a normal college experienceI don't mind the virtual classes so much because I feel like I still did a good job learning things and being productive when that was happening in the spring they're not too worried about that but I am a little bit sad that I'm not going to be able to continue my job on campus or joint or still be in the clubs Pratt like the meeting in person that I was doing last year it was kind of hard to have it have my freshman year basically just and right in the middle because you know it's only March you're still kind of getting used to college you're still needing people you're still joining clubs and that just kind of it all just got cut off for me and I feel like I didn't do as much in my freshman year as I probably could have and it was just hard toit's just hard knowing that that's time that I'm probably not going to get back being at home has its ups and downs like I think that I'm an introvert and it's been easier for me to kind of spend more time at my house and my cats are here and my cats aren't in my college dorm so I'm kind of glad that I don't have to say goodbye to him at the end of the summer I've been trying to really self-regulate and really make sure that I am taking time to self care I've been reading a lot more I've been I'm into history so I'm just kind of acquired more books than I could probably read in two years but I want to learn more about the world and about history and I'm trying to do that now because I mean I have the time for it I might as welldo something useful with it that's my goal anything to kind of keep from watching the news incessantly and just watching the death toll rise like I don't know anybody who's a healthcare worker or who's in it essential work or anything but I'm a very empathetic person and watching the death numbers just climb and climb and climb and college students not wearing masks and things it's just it's kind of hard to watch and it makes me feel like afraid inside even for all these people that I don't know and I just want them all to be safe and I feel so badly that they have to be risking their lives in these awful conditionsso I'm letting me and my family are just it feels like we're doing everything that we can and lots of people for the people that we've seen here we know who don't want to wear masks they are and it's kind of frustrating just to not have that just to have that not be a thing that is Paramount and everybody's minds but I think we're getting around to it and getting the idea of it being more widespread so that's good so we're just hanging in there like it could be a lot worse for us and I think we're all grateful that we are where we are but there's definitely downsides to this that I wasn't really expecting and things that I've come to miss just that weren't that I didn't think we're really going to be big singsbut it's definitely could be worse and I just need to tell myself that need to keep reading keep my mind off things and things are okay","user_id":null,"encrypted":1},{"id":5049,"created_at":"2020-07-22 14:13:20","updated_at":"2020-08-03 23:43:14","upload_id":5611,"text":"so I just turned 19 about a week and a half ago I'm going to be a sophomore in college and obviously this pandemic just kind of came right around three-quarters of the way through my first year at college and basically just in two days the entire School kind of shut down like on Tuesday go by Tuesday of that week Harvard and Ohio State and all those places had started to shut down so everybody was kind of thinking that our school our school would probably end up shutting down at some point and then Wednesday we get an email from the chancellor saying that the school is going to be shut down for a few weeks afterspring break and when we leave for spring break we should pack everything that we need to continue learning remotely so we do that and everybody leaves the dorms and everybody goes home and then we never ended up coming back to school and I'm pretty sure that we're not going to end up really going back to school March in the fall it's hard like for me because I want to know what's happening in my school hasn't really put out much information about what's in person and what's not because I'm really hoping that I don't have to be in person at all this semester or this year depending on what things are like in February just because my dad has underlying health conditions and I really don't want todo anything or go anywhere that's going to make it possible for me to get the virus and pass it on to him and my family so I've just been at home for the past month since March and there have been good and bad things about it like I'm glad that I'm here with my cats because they aren't allowed to come in my dorm room so that's fun and I have like I don't know I'm an introvert so I thought that it wouldn't affect me is bad just because you know I'm not I'm not as social as other people who are really struggling with not seeing their friends but it's it's getting to me too and not just like the fact that you can't really go out and do anythingand I can't really see my friends or my cousin's it's just more of light you know you see what's on the news and I see all these people getting sick and all these people dying and it's just incredibly hard for me as an empathetic person to hear that and to not have that really affect me and it's just hard hearing that like my parents and I we all really like to watch the news so we watch the news and it's like I can't watch it all that much because otherwise it just gets to be too much and I've been trying to be productive I think I was productive with school I have been reading a lot I have kind of gotten moreI think I've gotten more books than I could read in like 2 years but I'm just trying to give myself outlets and learn things about the world about history which is what I'm really interested in just so I'm not thinking about this all the time and I have an internship that I'm managing to do virtually but that's only for the summer and I'm not sure what's going to happen in the fall and if I'm going to have any way to earn money which I don't need to think believe because I'm probably just going to be here with my parents because I don't want to go to campus and potentially pick something up there so it could be worse but this is also honestly affecting me more than I thought it would and I have to like I had struggles with anxiety before this and obviously this just makes it all a lot worse so I've hadbe careful and make sure that I'm still going to my therapy and still seeing people via FaceTime once in a while and it's been okay and I've been able to manage it I think

better because there were no distractions they were just home another positive aspect was that since we didn't have to travel we have more time for studying so my second grader who wasn't doing too well we've been able to catch up and he's doing much better now my 6th grader he's doing really well he was able to finish up Lassie last school year on honor roll which was something that he was never able to do so that was great and now he's doing really well I think that being home has an advantage because there's more types of studies since you don't have to travel back and forth to school
